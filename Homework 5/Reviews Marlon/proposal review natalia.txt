Hello Natalia,
I really enjoyed reading your project proposal since it offers a few interesting concepts and is written in a way that portrays real interest in the topic.
The project seems reasonably hard to complete and offers a lot of potential for analysis and study of the result.
Between explainability and comparison of human and artificial agent behavior in a game setting this project is well situated and very interesting.
I would also suggest elaborating on your motivation a bit more in the report you are going to write as to why you chose this topic and what its applications and implications are.
Although I am confident you will be careful a small bit of advice would be to take extra care with your formulation since the line between claim, hypothesis and tangent can become a bit blurred, especially when related to the topic of the human mind or brain.
I hope that, should you choose this topic in the end, you will succeed in making it work the way you envisioned it.

All the Best,
Marlon Dammann
