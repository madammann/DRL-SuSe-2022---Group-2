Documentation Ideas - Example project is uploaded

Suggestion - Integrated Gradients

Milestones

MVP - Something that learned at least a bit

Exhaustive search - minimax

Subgoals: 

Step 1: Connect 4 Environment - almost completed, should also work with bigger grids
	Observation should fit the model

	Multi-agent gym environment exists - self-implementation is better with reasons

Step 2: Basic RL algorithm / Tree-search algorithm
	Basic RL might be difficult??
	Tree-search is a good idea 

Step 3: DQN and training

Step 4: Reading Literature

----- First Milestone Reached -----


Timeline? Nothing is fixed so far
Maybe reach the 1st Milestone within a month (End of August)

-----------------------------------

HW4

Seriously trying is the most important part. Failed code is okay. 
 
-----------------------------------

Python for neuroevolution is completely fine. 
We have to go through neuroevolution ourselves.
